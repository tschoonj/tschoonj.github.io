Hi there,

My name is Tom Schoonjans.

Some quick facts about me:

* Born in Anderlecht (Belgium) on March 26, 1982
* Studied chemistry (MSc) at Ghent University
* Did a PhD on X-ray Fluorescence from 2006 to 2012 at the same university
* Currently a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Sassari (Sardinia, Italy)

I have a passion for coding, which I developed during my PhD research. My favorite weapons are C and Fortran, although I also have some skill in Perl and IDL.
Most of my development occurs on a Mac, which comes with a collection of [virtual machines](http://virtualbox>.org), allowing me to produce releases of my software for all major platforms.

My main projects are [xraylib](http://github.com/tschoonj/xraylib), [XMI-MSIM](http://github.com/tschoonj/xmimsim) and [XRMC](http://github.com/golosio/xrmc), all of which are directly connected to my scientific research: Monte Carlo simulations of interactions of X-ray photons with matter. If you happen to be involved in this field of research as well, there's a good chance you may find them interesting, so feel free to check them out.

I created this blog with the goal of sharing some of the more interesting problems I come across during my coding streaks, wherever I can with solutions.

Hope you may find this blog interesting. Don't hesitate to drop a comment, that would be greatly appreciated.
